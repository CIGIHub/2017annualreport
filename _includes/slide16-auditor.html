<p><strong>Report of the Independent Auditors on the Summary Financial Statements</strong><br>
To the Directors of The Centre for International Governance Innovation,</p>
<p>The accompanying summary financial statements, which comprise the summary balance sheet as at July 31, 2017 and the summary statement of revenue, expenses and changes in fund balances for the year then ended, and related notes, are derived from the financial statements of The Centre for International Governance Innovation (the “Organization”) as at, and for the year ended, July 31, 2017. We expressed an unmodified audit opinion on those financial statements in our report dated December 1, 2017.  Those financial statements, and the summary financial statements, do not reflect the effects of events that occurred subsequent to the date of our report on those financial statements.</p>
<p>The summary financial statements do not contain all the disclosures required by Canadian accounting standards for not-for-profit organizations. Reading the summary financial statements, therefore, is not a substitute for reading the audited financial statements of the Organization.</p>
<p><strong>Management’s Responsibility for the Summary Financial Statements</strong><br/>
    Management is responsible for the preparation of a summary of the financial statements on a basis developed by management, which includes removing the statement of cash flows, retaining major subtotals, totals and comparative information, and retaining the information from the audited financial statements dealing with matters having a pervasive or otherwise significant effect on the summary financial statements.</p>
<p><strong>Auditors’ Responsibility</strong><br/>
    Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the summary financial statements based on our procedures, which were conducted in accordance with Canadian Auditing Standard 810, “Engagements to Report on Summary Financial Statements”.</p>
<p><strong>Opinion</strong><br/>
    In our opinion, the summary financial statements derived from the financial statements of the Organization as at, and for the year ended, July 31, 2017 are a fair summary of those financial statements in accordance with the basis developed by management, which includes removing the statement of cash flows, retaining major subtotals, totals and comparative information, and retaining the information from the audited financial statements dealing with matters having a pervasive or otherwise significant effect on the summary financial statements.</p>
    <p><strong>Other matter</strong><br/>
        The audited financial statements of the Organization are available upon request by contacting the Organization.
