From its opening lines about the high-profile hack of extramarital affair website Ashley Madison and later analysis of Edward Snowden’s revelations of government spying on internet users, [Look Who’s Watching: Surveillance, Treachery and Trust Online](https://www.cigionline.org/publications/look-whos-watching-surveillance-treachery-and-trust-online?source=ar2017 "Look Who's Watching") demonstrates that public trust in the internet is often misplaced and is quickly eroding.

Global Security & Politics Program Director Fen Osler Hampson and Research Fellow Eric Jardine draw on extensive research, including multiple CIGI-Ipsos surveys and the final report of the CIGI-Chatham House Global Commission on Internet Governance, to examine why users are losing trust in the internet. They conclude that restoring trust in the internet is vital and possible through deliberate policy action.

Look Who’s Watching is a semifinalist for the prestigious 2018 Grawemeyer Award, was listed among the best books of 2016 by The Hill Times and is shaping conversations in university classrooms through course adoptions.
