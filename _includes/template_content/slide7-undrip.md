In 2016, Canada’s Indigenous and Northern Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett reversed Canada’s objector status and endorsed the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).

International Law Research Program Director Oonagh Fitzgerald’s team responded by bringing together recommendations from Indigenous legal scholars and policy leaders on how Canada can build a new legal framework through the implementation of UNDRIP, revive a stalled process of reconciliation and embrace a true nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous peoples. The resulting special report, *UNDRIP Implementation: Braiding International, Domestic and Indigenous Laws*, was launched in Ottawa and became one of CIGI’s most-read digital publications of the year with 650 online downloads. 

As Indigenous issues made headlines throughout the spring, the report’s authors shared their expertise at subsequent events in Winnipeg and Geneva. Influential policy makers also took notice: the report was retweeted by Minister Bennett, Senator Ratna Omidvar and Ontario Human Rights Commissioner Renu Mandhane.
