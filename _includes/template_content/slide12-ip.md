In collaboration with the Ontario Ministry of Research, Innovation and Science, CIGI organized a series of round tables on innovation and intellectual property (IP) strategy with policy makers, academics and representatives of Canada’s business community that helped establish CIGI as a nationwide resource for policy advice on IP innovation.

CIGI’s legal experts have also been working to support new entrepreneurs and innovators with early access to IP legal support. In February 2017, CIGI announced a new partnership with York University to expand the IP Osgoode Innovation Clinic. The clinic provides pro bono basic legal services in IP law and business-related issues, with students working and learning alongside lawyers to assist early entrepreneurs who cannot afford to pay the costs.

Bassem Awad, deputy director, intellectual property law and innovation, sees the venture as a potential model for raising IP awareness and delivering legal advice that could be applied in other countries.
