The latest book by senior fellow and journalist Paul Blustein, [Laid Low: Inside the Crisis That Overwhelmed Europe and the IMF](https://www.cigionline.org/publications/laid-low-inside-crisis-overwhelmed-europe-and-imf?source=ar2017 "Laid Low"), goes behind the scenes at the highest levels of global economic policy making, chronicling the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF’s) role in the euro-zone crisis.

Opening with the sensational arrest of IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the book reveals that this sordid episode was only one in a series of setbacks for the IMF as financial conflagration spread from Greece to Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Cyprus — threatening to engulf a region comprising nearly one-fifth of world economic output.

Foreign Affairs praised Laid Low’s authoritative account of the euro-zone crisis: “Until now, a serious treatment of the International Monetary Fund’s role in the crisis has been missing.” A sentiment doubtlessly echoed by government officials in Washington, who asked him to testify before the US Congress on “Lessons from the IMF’s Bailout of Greece.”
