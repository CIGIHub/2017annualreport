# Solutions for a Low-carbon Economy

New research from Senior Fellow Céline Bak focused on low-carbon economic policies in the run-up to the 2017 Think 20 (T20) and Group of Twenty (G20) meetings in Germany. As co-chair of the T20 Task Force on Climate Policy and Finance, her group’s recommendations drove discussions among leaders looking for global solutions to foster a low-carbon economy.

Bak subsequently presented her research to Canada’s Parliamentary Standing Committee on Natural Resources, incorporated the theme of the brief in a joint letter from T20 groups opposing the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, hosted a meeting with public and private sector leaders to consider a road map toward green finance and was a popular spokesperson on the G20’s approach to climate action.
