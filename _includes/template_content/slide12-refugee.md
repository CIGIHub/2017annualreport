# Transforming the Global Refugee System

Twenty-one million people are refugees and the number continues to rise. The international response has been uneven, prompting CIGI to convene thought leaders and innovators from around the globe to advance a new vision of global cooperation for refugee protection.

The [World Refugee Council](https://www.worldrefugeecouncil.org?source=ar2017 "World Refugee Council") is chaired by Lloyd Axworthy, former Canadian minister of foreign affairs, and co-chaired by Jakaya Kikwete, former president of Tanzania; Hina Jilani, an advocate of the Supreme Court of Pakistan; and Rita Süssmuth, immigration reform advocate and former president of the German Bundestag.

Launched with the support of the Government of Canada and other institutions, the council was lauded by Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland and civil society groups when it was publicly announced in May 2017. The council’s bold mandate has also been met with passionate online interest, generating over 370,000 social media impressions and 10,000 engagements.
