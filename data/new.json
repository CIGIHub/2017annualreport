The debate over the advisability of including ISDS continues, even though the North American Free Trade Agreement ushered in an era of transparency investment treaties. This paper argues that if ISDS were abandoned, governments might again be subject to strong political pressures to formally or informally espouse investor claims and such claims would become the key factor in their foreign relations with host countries. The creation of an ISDS mechanism that relieves the US government from undertaking the settlement of investment disputes, and the evolution of US investment protection that is significantly more friendly to host governments and to regulation, are the principal themes of this paper. \r\n"

These effects damage economic performance (for particular countries, and potentially for the global economic system as a whole) and create political hurdles to international integration and cooperation.  This lecture will explore the economic rationale for beggar-thy-neighbour trade strategies, and will consider the sorts of governance mechanisms that would be necessary to regulate this dimension of international competition, so that the economic promise of efficiency-enhancing trade might be experienced more genuinely by all parties."

      "summary": "The European Commission has recently taken a leadership role in reforming the traditional investor-state dispute settlement regime included in economic agreements, in part in response to pressure from the European Parliament and growing civil society criticisms of the regime. At the core of these efforts is the proposal to create a system of \u201cinvestment courts,\u201d characterized by state nomination of decision makers benefiting from tenure and by the establishment of appellate-level tribunals. The European Commission has gone to great lengths to contrast this \u201cnew, modernised system\u201d with the \u201cold, traditional form of dispute resolution\u201d between investors and states. In the long term, the European Commission\u2019s goal is to replace individual courts with a truly multilateral investment court.\r\n"

      "summary": "Although the present system for resolving investment disputes between states and foreign investors has been around for about five decades, the most significant changes to it have occurred in just the past two. Important changes were forced upon the system when developed countries first were faced with actual prospects of appearing as respondents in investor-state arbitration, starting with the North American Free Trade Agreement. Further provisions have been introduced in later, new-generation, treaties, based on lessons learned and reactions from the respective constituencies. As the issue of the continuing development of the system remains relevant to all countries, there is the need for a mechanism that ensures its balanced evolution for the benefit of all its users, which would not be dependent on the reactionary steps of only segments of the user community at any given time."

      "summary": "The implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change should follow a rights-centred approach, not only because negative climate change impacts can directly affect several human rights, but also because actions to address climate change may also provoke unintended human rights consequences. Using a contextual analysis of international law developments that occurred alongside the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015, especially the international agreement on the Sustainable Development Goals, this paper argues that states have properly integrated a human rights dimension into key operative provisions of the Paris Agreement, albeit indirectly."

Tensions have also escalated with China."

      "summary": "Excessive corporate risk taking by systemically important financial firms is widely seen as one of the primary causes of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. In response, governments have issued or are considering an array of regulatory measures to attempt to curb that risk taking and prevent another crisis. This policy brief argues that these measures are inadequate, and that controlling excessive risk taking also requires regulation of corporate governance.\u00a0\r\n"

However, zero-rating is controversial, raising issues of net neutrality \u2014 the concept that all content should be treated equally on the Internet \u2014 market power, privacy, security and social equity.

However, the creation of intellectual property rights (IPRs), which were originally developed for a world of sparse and sporadic invention, has led to potential stumbling blocks for industrialized research and development and continuous and massively parallel innovation. This potential has been actualized through the untrammelled proliferation of IPRs in recent decades. This paper argues that this proliferation has strategic roots at the national level, based on the potential to capture global rents through the internationalization of IPRs."

Despite extensive fiscal adjustment, together with a series of debt restructurings, public debt levels remained unsustainable in 10 countries in 2015. Projections for future debt sustainability are also bleak. Ten options are proposed in this paper, together with some key actions, as a foundation for developing a new approach to resolving unsustainable Caribbean debt."

As such, countries have placed the development of normative standards guiding state behaviour in cyberspace at the top of their foreign policy agendas. Yet, despite broad international consensus regarding the basic principles to limit ICTs' misuse in the digital age and to constrain state behaviour, the key tenets have been consistently violated. This paper offers five standards of care that can be used to test individual states\u2019 true commitment to the international norms of behaviour in cyberspace. \r\n"

At its inception, IP was incentive-based. The IP system encouraged innovation by providing innovators with a period of exclusivity to enable them to commercially exploit the tangible manifestations of their creativity, free from copycats or free riders. Once that period of exclusivity expired, the IP became free for all to use. IP rights were, therefore, created in order to achieve the socio-economic policy goal of encouraging the wide dissemination of new ideas to enable others to learn from and build upon them."

      "summary": "The fair and equitable treatment (FET) standard has long been considered an indispensable part of international investment protection agreements and is often invoked in investor-state arbitration (ISA). Particularly after the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into effect in 1994, the standard went through a transformation from a little-known clause to being subject to ever expanding interpretations by arbitral tribunals. Although states have taken steps to rein in the use of the FET standard, these efforts have come undone in arbitral tribunals. The result of this situation has been some controversial awards in which both supporters and critics of ISA see a problematic development. Just as NAFTA propelled the FET standard to new heights, NAFTA parties can also send an important message to the arbitral community by removing it from this watershed agreement. This paper argues that this step will reduce instances of creative interpretations by arbitral tribunals and help improve the integrity of ISA."

Following the country visit, the working group is likely to recommend that Canada develop a national action plan for the implementation of the UNGPs.

This policy brief recommends that the Province of Ontario adopt the model law. By doing so, the province will bring the rule of law and fairness into sovereign debt restructurings and further enhance Toronto\u2019s position as a world-class financial jurisdiction."

      "summary": "Energy is a critical resource that links the factors of production and influences socioeconomic development in communities, and its importance in driving development within social and economic systems cannot be underestimated. It is, however, critical that energy development initiatives are linked to economic activity to stimulate socioeconomic development. This paper contributes to the discourse on global development through rural electrification by presenting cases on energy delivery for rural development in three developing countries on different continents."

The main theme was the feasibility of implementing a model law in Ontario that could become the choice of law for sovereign debt contracts.\u00a0The model law, if implemented, would create a new and improved regime. \r\n"

Contestation over the legal recognition of geographical indications (GIs) has been at the centre of discussion among global IP players in the past few years. This paper provides a brief history of the international legal recognition of GIs, discusses the rationale for the protection of GIs and critically analyzes the treatment of GIs in two significant preferential trade agreements involving Canada, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement and the now-halted Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, which may constitute the foundations of a renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement."

In that spirit, this paper looks at the implications of the financial crises of the last decade on international governance."

This paper reports on the results and policy recommendations of a project about climate risks and opportunities in the Canadian financial sector. The project involved interviews with financial sector representatives and an extensive literature analysis. Results suggest that Canadian financial institutions may not be prepared for climate change-related disclosure requirements, such as the one published by the FSB Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. It is recommended that climate change-related risk and opportunity assessment tools be developed, based on climate change scenarios and Canadian climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies."

Because a significant percentage of sovereign debt is governed by English law, there is an opportunity to modify the law to fairly and equitably facilitate the restructuring of unsustainable sovereign debt. This policy brief proposes a novel legal framework, focusing on governing law, for doing that. Even absent the legislative proposal, the analysis in this policy brief can contribute to the incremental development of sovereign debt restructuring norms."

Most of the existing SEP research has focused on advanced countries, primarily the United States. Yet fundamental changes in the geography of SEP markets give rise to the emergence of new players. It is time to move beyond a US-centric analysis. This report contributes new insights by broadening the geographic coverage of the research. Drawing on decades of research on China\u2019s innovation policy in information technology (IT), and on interviews with experts on China\u2019s policies on patents and standards, the study sheds light on a gradual process of concentrated geographic dispersion of SEP ownership in the IT industry, and presents indicators of China\u2019s ascent.
