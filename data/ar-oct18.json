Particularly after the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into effect in 1994, the standard went through a transformation from a little-known clause to being subject to ever expanding interpretations by arbitral tribunals. Although states have taken steps to rein in the use of the FET standard, these efforts have come undone in arbitral tribunals. The result of this situation has been some controversial awards in which both supporters and critics of ISA see a problematic development. Just as NAFTA propelled the FET standard to new heights, NAFTA parties can also send an important message to the arbitral community by removing it from this watershed agreement. This paper argues that this step will reduce instances of creative interpretations by arbitral tribunals and help improve the integrity of ISA.","image":true},{"id":"12466","title":"How Small Open Economies Can Leverage the Trade in Ideas","subtitle":"New thinking on innovation, trade and productivity","authors":["Dan Ciuriak"],"published_date":"2017-05-02T18:41:48","url_landing_page":"http://www.cigionline.org/articles/how-small-open-economies-can-leverage-trade-ideas","pdf_url":"","type":"Opinion","subtype":["Opinion"],"word_count":1866,"program":[],"research_areas":["Innovation & Productivity"],"summary":"As Canada prepares to negotiate, or renegotiate, trade arrangements in a new post-Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), possibly post-North American Free Trade Agreement and — if it dare be imagined — post-World Trade Organization world, it becomes vital to understand what it was about the established model of globalization, and the trade agreements that helped to generate it, worked for small, open economies such as Canada.","image":true},{"id":"12583","title":"Overcoming Barriers to Meeting the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction","subtitle":"CIGI Policy Brief No. 105","authors":["Jason Thistlethwaite","Daniel Henstra"],"published_date":"2017-05-03T13:15:22","url_landing_page":"http://www.cigionline.org/publications/overcoming-barriers-meeting-sendai-framework-disaster-risk-reduction-0","pdf_url":"http://www.cigionline.org/sites/default/files/documents/PB%20no.105web_0.pdf","type":"Publication","subtype":["Policy Briefs"],"word_count":5050,"program":["Global Economy"],"research_areas":["Environment & Energy"],"summary":"Canada’s adoption of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction represents an important opportunity to manage flood risk, which is the most common and costly hazard facing Canadians.

Drawing on decades of research on China’s innovation policy in information technology (IT), and on interviews with experts on China’s policies on patents and standards, the study sheds light on a gradual process of concentrated geographic dispersion of SEP ownership in the IT industry, and presents indicators of China’s ascent.
