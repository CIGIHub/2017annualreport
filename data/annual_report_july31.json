The debate over the advisability of including ISDS continues, even though the North American Free Trade Agreement ushered in an era of transparency investment treaties. This paper argues that if ISDS were abandoned, governments might again be subject to strong political pressures to formally or informally espouse investor claims and such claims would become the key factor in their foreign relations with host countries. The creation of an ISDS mechanism that relieves the US government from undertaking the settlement of investment disputes, and the evolution of US investment protection that is significantly more friendly to host governments and to regulation, are the principal themes of this paper.

      "summary": "Contrary to the predictions of abstract economic theories, liberalized global trade in practice does not \"lift all boats.\"  In reality, international competition for exports and investment can lead to zero-sum or beggar-thy-neighbour consequences, producing losers as well as winners.  These effects damage economic performance (for particular countries, and potentially for the global economic system as a whole) and create political hurdles to international integration and cooperation.  This lecture will explore the economic rationale for beggar-thy-neighbour trade strategies, and will consider the sorts of governance mechanisms that would be necessary to regulate this dimension of international competition, so that the economic promise of efficiency-enhancing trade might be experienced more genuinely by all parties."

Further provisions have been introduced in later, new-generation, treaties, based on lessons learned and reactions from the respective constituencies. As the issue of the continuing development of the system remains relevant to all countries, there is the need for a mechanism that ensures its balanced evolution for the benefit of all its users, which would not be dependent on the reactionary steps of only segments of the user community at any given time."

International aviation is a growing sectoral player in greenhouse gas emissions. The draft resolution establishing the global market-based measure (MBM) of the International Civil Aviation Organization recognizes the complementarity of the global MBM and various other measures in achieving emissions reductions goals. These goals have been clarified by the 2015 Paris Agreement. The proposed MBM should utilize a standard that fosters sustainable development, works to link with existing emissions trading schemes and aims to foster carbon-reducing growth."

However, the creation of intellectual property rights (IPRs), which were originally developed for a world of sparse and sporadic invention, has led to potential stumbling blocks for industrialized research and development and continuous and massively parallel innovation. This potential has been actualized through the untrammelled proliferation of IPRs in recent decades. This paper argues that this proliferation has strategic roots at the national level, based on the potential to capture global rents through the internationalization of IPRs."

Canada is now home to some of the toughest anti-piracy rules in the world, but the focus on infringement has come at a cost. Canadian copyright law is unquestionably supportive of cracking down on piracy, but it lacks the flexibility needed for new creativity and innovation."

Despite extensive fiscal adjustment, together with a series of debt restructurings, public debt levels remained unsustainable in 10 countries in 2015. Projections for future debt sustainability are also bleak. Ten options are proposed in this paper, together with some key actions, as a foundation for developing a new approach to resolving unsustainable Caribbean debt."

At its inception, IP was incentive-based. The IP system encouraged innovation by providing innovators with a period of exclusivity to enable them to commercially exploit the tangible manifestations of their creativity, free from copycats or free riders. Once that period of exclusivity expired, the IP became free for all to use. IP rights were, therefore, created in order to achieve the socio-economic policy goal of encouraging the wide dissemination of new ideas to enable others to learn from and build upon them."

      "summary": "The progress of the China-US bilateral investment treaty (BIT) talks shows that China is embracing a next-generation BIT. Complicated domestic politics have influenced the last stage of the China-US BIT talks. While top leadership in China must intervene to break the stalemate, the US business community has pressed hard on the US government on a variety of issues. China\u2019s acceptance of the next-generation BIT with unilateral liberalization is promising for the forthcoming China-Canada free trade agreement talks. It could be much easier for the two sides to reach agreement on investment and service trade. The talks offer China and Canada a special opportunity to stabilize the regional and world trade order currently challenged by rising protectionism."

      "summary": "The fair and equitable treatment (FET) standard has long been considered an indispensable part of international investment protection agreements and is often invoked in investor-state arbitration (ISA). Particularly after the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into effect in 1994, the standard went through a transformation from a little-known clause to being subject to ever expanding interpretations by arbitral tribunals. Although states have taken steps to rein in the use of the FET standard, these efforts have come undone in arbitral tribunals. The result of this situation has been some controversial awards in which both supporters and critics of ISA see a problematic development. Just as NAFTA propelled the FET standard to new heights, NAFTA parties can also send an important message to the arbitral community by removing it from this watershed agreement. This paper argues that this step will reduce instances of creative interpretations by arbitral tribunals and help improve the integrity of ISA."

Following the country visit, the working group is likely to recommend that Canada develop a national action plan for the implementation of the UNGPs.

This policy brief recommends that the Province of Ontario adopt the model law. By doing so, the province will bring the rule of law and fairness into sovereign debt restructurings and further enhance Toronto\u2019s position as a world-class financial jurisdiction."

      "summary": "In recent years, preferential trade agreements have had a major impact on the direction of rules in the domestic intellectual property (IP) landscape. Contestation over the legal recognition of geographical indications (GIs) has been at the centre of discussion among global IP players in the past few years. This paper provides a brief history of the international legal recognition of GIs, discusses the rationale for the protection of GIs and critically analyzes the treatment of GIs in two significant preferential trade agreements involving Canada, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement and the now-halted Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, which may constitute the foundations of a renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement."

But assessing climate change-related risks is complex, since the information needed for such assessments is fragmented, incomplete or not yet available. This paper reports on the results and policy recommendations of a project about climate risks and opportunities in the Canadian financial sector. The project involved interviews with financial sector representatives and an extensive literature analysis. Results suggest that Canadian financial institutions may not be prepared for climate change-related disclosure requirements, such as the one published by the FSB Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. It is recommended that climate change-related risk and opportunity assessment tools be developed, based on climate change scenarios and Canadian climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies."

Most of the existing SEP research has focused on advanced countries, primarily the United States. Yet fundamental changes in the geography of SEP markets give rise to the emergence of new players. It is time to move beyond a US-centric analysis. This report contributes new insights by broadening the geographic coverage of the research. Drawing on decades of research on China\u2019s innovation policy in information technology (IT), and on interviews with experts on China\u2019s policies on patents and standards, the study sheds light on a gradual process of concentrated geographic dispersion of SEP ownership in the IT industry, and presents indicators of China\u2019s ascent.
